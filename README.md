# Description
This repository contains the data, scripts, and documentation for the study "A Study of Repository Characteristics of Search Results from GitHub and Software Heritage Search Tools." The goal of this project is to explore the overlap, metadata differences, and search result relevance of repositories retrieved from GitHub and Software Heritage search tools using the keyword(We use "python" as an example).

# Research Questions
RQ1: How many repositories retrieved from Software Heritage are no longer valid on GitHub?
RQ2: For the same keyword, how many overlapping repositories are retrieved from GitHub and Software Heritage?
RQ3: How well does repositoriesâ€™ metadata (full names, descriptions, and readme) match with search keywords via search tools?
RQ4: What proportion of repositories are missing critical metadata like readme or description?
RQ5: What are the differences in repository metadata(stars, forks, age) between the two platforms?

# Raw dataset (selection process)

Due to our need, we need to request metadata for each repository.
However, Software Heritage API only allows 1200 requests per hour.
So we only select 1000 repositories from each platform (2000 repositories in total).

In keyword selection, we use "python" as an example. However, you can select any keyword to reproduce this study.

Before starting this study, you need to get your **tokens** of GitHub and Software Heritage and write them in Program ** 1. Github Search.py and 2. SWH Search.py**.

Purpose of the Dataset
The dataset includes:

Raw Data: Search results and metadata collected directly from the APIs of GitHub and Software Heritage.
Refined Data: Processed and analyzed data to address research questions on repository overlaps, metadata completeness, and semantic relevance.
Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


data/
raw/: Contains raw datasets retrieved from GitHub and Software Heritage APIs.
refined/: Contains processed datasets with metadata and analysis results.
scripts/
data_collection.py: Automates the retrieval of repository metadata from APIs.
data_processing.py: Processes raw datasets into a refined format.
semantic_similarity.py: Calculates semantic similarity for relevance analysis.
docs/
Contains the LaTeX files and PDF presentation of the study.
Includes a diagram of the selection and extraction processes.
results/
Visualizations and statistical summaries of the refined dataset.
