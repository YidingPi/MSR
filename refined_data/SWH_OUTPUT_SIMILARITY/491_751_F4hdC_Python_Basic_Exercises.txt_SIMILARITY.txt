### Some basic exercises with Python as a beginner

In the first folder "Entrega_1" theres 2 basics Exercises:
  * one of them is the famous Caesar Cipher with Shift 13 with Spanish comments, i think is very understandable, and the second is an Upper_Lower_Case counter that Count how many there are Upp or Low and the letters with accents.  

In the second folder "Entrega_2" We can observe from the title what can do the exercise. 
  * a converter from HEX to RGB and a decompresser of bits known as "Lossless"
