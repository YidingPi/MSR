ArcGIS 9.3 Script (drafted 7/2011) for exporting a large amount of shapefiles (in a single directory with numerous sub-directories and different geospatial file types) into
a geodatabase format.

Files that are in the incorrect projection are reprojected, and all invalid naming conventions are
corrected before the shapefile is exported into the database.

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY BEING MODIFIED TO FIT 10/10.1 ESRI ArcPy functions. 

*NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS STILL in progress as of 4/12/2013*
