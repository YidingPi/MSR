# Crazyflie PC client [![CI](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-clients-python/actions?query=workflow%3ACI) [![cfclient](https://snapcraft.io//cfclient/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/cfclient)


The Crazyflie PC client enables flashing and controlling the Crazyflie.
It implements the user interface and high-level control (for example gamepad handling).
The communication with Crazyflie and the implementation of the CRTP protocol to control the Crazyflie is handled by the [cflib](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python) project.
