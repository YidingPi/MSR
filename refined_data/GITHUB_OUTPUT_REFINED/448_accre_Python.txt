Scripts demonstrating how to run Python jobs on the 
ACCRE cluster. Each directory should contain at least
a Python script and SLURM script, and preferably a README.md
file providing details about the job, installation instructions,
etc.

Contributing New Examples

We encourage users to submit new examples of jobs they have
successfully run on the cluster. Instructions for submitting
