  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ets-labs/python-vimrc/master/setup.sh)"

During execution of init script do not worry about error messages. When it
occurs just press enter and wait till all plugins are installed.

--------------

Current bundle use one of the most comprehensive plugins for autocompletion - 
`Valloric/YouCompleteMe <https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe>`_.
YouCompleteMe autocompletion plugin requires additional installation that 
depends on environment and functionality you want to have. Detailed 
instructions could be found on plugin page: 
`Valloric/YouCompleteMe <https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation>`_.


**Note:** Installation for Mac OS with support of clang compiler looks like 
this:

.. code-block:: bash

  ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/install.py --clang-completer


Key bindings
============

This configuration tends to use standard VIM and installed plugins key 
bindings, but there are some custom key bindings as well:

.. code::

    # Common key bindings:

    inoremap jj     # Esc alternative
    inoremap jk     # Esc alternative

    nmap <F9>       # Jump to the previous buffer
    nmap <F10>      # Jump to the next buffer

    nmap <leader>q  # Delete buffer
    nmap "          # Toggle NERDTree buffer 

    # Python mode key bindings:

    let g:pymode_doc_key='K'
    let g:pymode_breakpoint_key='<leader>b'
    let g:pymode_run_bind='<F5>'

    nmap <leader>g :YcmCompleter GoTo<CR>
    nmap <leader>d :YcmCompleter GoToDefinition<CR>
