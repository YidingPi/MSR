# Machine Learning Blueprints by Packt

This repository will have practices from the book Python Machine Learning Blueprints by Packt.

All the content will be the material obtained by the book, so the rights aren't mine. Check the 
book source to know all the details.

If I can, i'll modify the practices to achieve better results or to expand the content.
