README:
A FLASK application to optimize portfolio allocation by providing users the exact number of shares to purchase for an optimal portfolio(max sharpe ratio), an equally balanced portfolio, or a minimal risk portfolio. Users can create and update a portfolio of stocks and can input the amount of capital they are looking to invest and will be given their portfolio allocation results based on these inputs. The application also has a forecasting feature where users can see 3 forecasts of what the next trading day's adjusted close price will be for any stock they pick. This is to help users in making allocation decisions.
