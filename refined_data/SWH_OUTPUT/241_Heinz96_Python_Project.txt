# Simple derivatives website
Project for the Python class

This program will launch the website from your local-host, and allow to price simple put, calls and autocalls and keep a price history.
We used Flask as the server and mongodb as the database, mongodb being connected remotely through mongo atlas.

## How to install

Just create a virtual environment through virtualenv, activate it and use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` for installing all the required packages, then run in `strategy_app` the `__init__.py`.
