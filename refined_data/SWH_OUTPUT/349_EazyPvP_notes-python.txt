Take notes easily. As if you couldn't already.

Feel free to modify the 33 lines of code to add your text editor.

# Setup
Simply, extract the zip file and add the directory to path. Run the `setup.py`, restart all terminal instances and type `notenow` and it should open up your prefered text editor. All notes are saved in the folder the script is run in.
