# Angela-yu ------100 days python coding Challenge___

Hello guys,

My name is Shashank Bhushan Shukla.This is my 100 days coding challenge for improve  my coding skill.Since my child hood i always wanted to be like Bill Gates ,Mark Zugurberg and the thing which most fasinated me was they build a empire from srach a self made billioner.I had only one thing in mind how to be super rich and the only way to be that person was to learn skills of coding.

And this started the journey of my life. Every desicion i took to become a Computer Science Enginner.

There were a lot of times i tried to learn programming. but to to the complexity of it. it was very hard for me to learn. I started with Java,C, HTML, CSS , and now its python.

Coding is not hard,everything depends on the practice we do the more we practice the more skilled and confident we become,
coding can change my life i feel it. I just need to consistant and this time i will not quit. No matter what ,the path i have chosen i will finish it till the end.

Thank you guys if you are Reading it .and a very much thank you to the techer who is helping me go through this journey Angela Yu on udemy.

This could turn out to be some thing great.
