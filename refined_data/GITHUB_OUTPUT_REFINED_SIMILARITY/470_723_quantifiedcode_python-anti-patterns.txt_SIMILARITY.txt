This is an open-source book of **Python anti-patterns and worst practices**. Check out `docs/index.rst` for more information.

**Notice**: This is still (and will always be) a work-in-progress, feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, adding new articles, improving existing ones, or translating this into other languages.

## PDF Version

You can find a PDF version of the book [here](./docs/The-Little-Book-Of-Python-Anti-Patterns.pdf).

## New articles
If you add new articles, please use the provided templates. Depending on the pattern you are creating, use either the [anti-pattern](templates/anti_pattern.rst) or the [migration-pattern](templates/migration_pattern.rst) template.

## Building the Documentation

To build the documentation, first install the required packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, go to the `src` directory and run `make`:

    # HTML pages
    make html
    # PDF version
    make latexpdf

For the PDF version, you will need a working LaTeX installation (e.g. texlive).

You will find the updated documentation in the `docs` folder afterwards. You can clean the folder by running `make clean`.
