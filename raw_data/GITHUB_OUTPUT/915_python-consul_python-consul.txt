README:
This repo was an early Python client for [Consul.io](http://www.consul.io/).

It was maintained roughly from 2014 to 2018 until the original maintainers stopped using Consul in their day-to-day stack.

As of April 2024, [criteo/py-consul](https://github.com/criteo/py-consul) appears to be the most well maintained fork.
