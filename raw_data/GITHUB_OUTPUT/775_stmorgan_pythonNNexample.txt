# Python Neural Network example
Annotations for the Sirajology Python Neural Network Example. This code comes from a demo NN program from the YouTube video https://youtu.be/h3l4qz76JhQ by Siraj. The program creates a neural network that simulates the exclusive OR function with two inputs and one output.

**PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.html** is an HTML version of the code. This is useful for reading the code on a webpage. 

**PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook version. This is not necessary but useful for those who want to see annotations as they run the code. 

**PythonNNExampleFromSirajology.py** This is just Python script. Annotations appear in comments.
