# Python One Liners

This repository collects all Python one-liners that are of interest to the Python community. One-Liners are concise snippets of source code (with or without library calls) that accomplish a given task in a concise and compressed manner. 

They are often used to call a Python script from the operating system terminal using the `python -c` command:

```python
python -c 'print("hello world")'
```
