## Overview

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) provides the tools and infrastructure
you need to develop apps, grow your user base, and earn money. The Firebase
Admin Python SDK enables access to Firebase services from privileged environments
(such as servers or cloud) in Python. Currently this SDK provides
Firebase custom authentication support.

[Firebase Admin SDK setup guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup/).


## Installation

To install Firebase Admin Python SDK, simply execute the following command
in a terminal:
